          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(a)</strong> The offers of inevis GmbH are - unless otherwise agreed in writing - always non-binding and subject to change until the contract is concluded and are subject to a positive check of the customer&quot;s credit limit. When ordering online on the inevis GmbH dealer portal, the customer declares by clicking the order button that they wish to purchase the selected content of the product range. inevis GmbH is entitled to reject the contractual offer contained therein.

All mutual legal transactions only come into effect after receipt of a written order confirmation from inevis GmbH, at the latest upon execution of the delivery.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(b)</strong> inevis GmbH reserves the right to correct printing errors and mistakes as well as minor deviations in quality and design, provided that these do not contradict a contractual obligation or agreement, and do not constitute defects. The information provided in our offers and online shop serves as a product description. They do not represent guaranteed properties. The customer is bound to the order placed for four weeks.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Prices / Payment / Default</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(a)</strong> Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the prices are net prices in EURO and do not include costs for freight, transport, insurance, packaging and statutory duties, in particular the legally applicable sales tax. Unless otherwise agreed, the generally applicable list price of inevis GmbH on the day of delivery applies.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(b)</strong> Invoicing takes place upon delivery, delivery to the customer against cash on delivery, unless other written agreements have been made. In the case of delivery on open account, the entire invoice amount must be paid within the payment periods stated in the inevis GmbH invoices.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(c)</strong> Payment default occurs when the claim is due without the need for a reminder. In the event of payment default, inevis GmbH is entitled to demand default interest of 10% above the base interest rate. inevis GmbH reserves the right to claim higher or further damages.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Offsetting / Retention / Assignment</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(a)</strong> Set-off by the customer is only permitted with undisputed and legally established claims.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(b)</strong> The assertion of liens by the buyer is excluded. Likewise excluded are the customer&quot;s rights of retention if they do not arise from the same legal relationship.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Delivery / Shipping / Transfer of Risk</h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(a)</strong>  Deliveries are made from the Frankfurt warehouse at the customer&quot;s expense. The risk of accidental deterioration or loss of the goods passes to the customer upon their handover, or in the case of a sale by dispatch, upon delivery of the item to the carrier, forwarding agent or another person or company designated to carry out the shipment. inevis GmbH is entitled to deliver from another location at any time, e.g. directly from the manufacturer&quot;s factory. The respective conditions then apply accordingly. Partial deliveries and partial services by inevis GmbH are permitted.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(b)</strong> inevis GmbH is not responsible for unforeseen obstacles to performance, such as those caused by sub-suppliers or force majeure, even in the case of agreed delivery periods, and entitles inevis GmbH to cancel delivery obligations in whole or in part, to extend delivery dates appropriately or to withdraw from the contract in whole or in part. inevis GmbH is only obliged to perform within the scope of proper self-delivery and assumes no liability for the risk of procurement. This also applies in the event of a delay in delivery that has already occurred.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(c)</strong> Delivery dates specified are non-binding guidelines. Expressly agreed delivery dates are deemed to have been met upon notification of readiness for dispatch and upon dispatch of the goods. Delivery dates are only valid under the condition that inevis GmbH receives its own deliveries properly and on time. In the event of a continuous impediment to performance lasting more than three months, the customer is entitled to withdraw from the part of the contract that has not yet been fulfilled, subject to a reasonable grace period of at least 10 working days.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>(d)</strong>  If a specific type of transport has not been expressly agreed in writing, the choice of transport route and type of transport is made by inevis GmbH without liability for the cheapest freight. The unconditional acceptance of the shipment by the railway, freight carrier or warehouse keeper is considered proof of the perfect condition of the goods and the transport packaging and excludes claims against inevis GmbH for damage, subject to proof to the contrary. Insurance is only taken out at the express written request of the customer and is at the customer&quot;s expense. If the shipment or delivery is delayed by the customer (delay in acceptance), inevis GmbH is entitled to demand storage fees of at least Â½% of the net invoice amount for each month started, starting 30 days after notification of readiness for shipment, subject to proof to the contrary. inevis GmbH also has the right to demand a higher amount upon proof. If the customer does not accept the goods after a grace period set for him, inevis is entitled to withdraw from the contract and to assert the rights under Section 10 of this agreement (compensation for refusal to accept) against the customer.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Retention of title / security</h3>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(a)</strong> inevis GmbH retains title to the goods delivered (reserved goods) until all of its claims against the customer arising from the business relationship, including future claims from contracts concluded at the same time or later, have been settled. This also applies if individual or all of inevis GmbH&quot;s claims have been included in a current invoice and the balance has been drawn and acknowledged.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(b)</strong> The customer is obliged to treat the reserved goods with the necessary care and to insure them adequately against theft, fire and water damage at his own expense. The customer is only entitled to resell the reserved goods, to which inevis GmbH reserves title, in the ordinary course of business if the customer hereby and now assigns to inevis GmbH as security all existing and future claims in the amount of the final invoice amount that the customer has against buyers or third parties from the resale. However, the customer is not permitted to pledge or transfer the reserved goods as security. If reserved goods are sold unprocessed or after processing, reworking or combining with items that are the exclusive property of inevis GmbH, the processing, reworking or combining was carried out for inevis GmbH and the customer now assigns the claims in the final invoice amount arising from the resale to inevis GmbH. If the customer sells the reserved goods - after processing/combining them with goods that do not belong to inevis GmbH - inevis GmbH is entitled to the resulting co-ownership share, provided that sole ownership of the new item was acquired by the customer or a third party, and the customer hereby and now assigns the claims arising from the resale in the amount of the final invoice amount of the reserved goods with all ancillary rights and priority over the rest. inevis GmbH accepts the assignment. The customer is authorized to collect these claims even after the assignment. The authority of inevis GmbH to collect the claims itself remains unaffected by this; however, inevis GmbH undertakes not to collect the claim as long as the customer properly meets its payment and other obligations.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(c)</strong> inevis GmbH may demand that the customer inform it of the assigned claims and their debtors, provide all information necessary for collection, hand over the relevant documents and inform the debtors of the assignment.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(d)</strong> The customer is obliged to immediately notify inevis GmbH in writing of any action that could impair or endanger the reserved ownership of the purchased item. The customer must provide inevis GmbH with all information necessary for defensive measures. Any costs of defensive measures that cannot be reimbursed by third parties will be reimbursed to inevis GmbH by the customer.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(e)</strong> inevis GmbH is entitled at any time, even after conclusion of a contract, to demand sufficient security to secure its claims, including those not yet due, and to make further advance payments by inevis GmbH dependent on this. This applies in particular if doubts arise about the customer&quot;s creditworthiness, underfunding or liquidity gaps, etc., or if the original credit volume increases.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(f)</strong> After withdrawal from the contract due to the customer&quot;s breach of contract, inevis GmbH is entitled to demand the return of the reserved goods or the assignment of the customer&quot;s claim for return against third parties.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Warranty / Limitation Period</h3>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>(a)</strong> The prerequisite for any claims for defects by the customer against inevis GmbH is that the customer has complied with the inspection and complaint obligations in accordance with Section 377 of the German Commercial Code (HGB).</p>
