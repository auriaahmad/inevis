        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. General / Scope</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> All legal transactions with the customers of inevis GmbH, in particular contracts for deliveries, are concluded exclusively on the basis of the following general terms and conditions, insofar as these are carried out for a natural or legal person or a partnership with legal capacity in the exercise of their commercial or independent professional activity (hereinafter referred to as the customer). By registering in the dealer portal of inevis GmbH, the customer declares that he has taken note of these terms and conditions and accepts their validity and inclusion in their respective current version for all legal transactions within the scope of the business relationship. By accepting the delivery or service, the customer declares his consent to the validity of these conditions for all future transactions at the latest.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Offer / Conclusion of Contract</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> The offers of inevis GmbH are - unless otherwise agreed in writing - always non-binding and subject to change until the contract is concluded and are subject to a positive check of the customer&quot;s credit limit. When ordering online on the inevis GmbH dealer portal, the customer declares by clicking the order button that they wish to purchase the selected content of the product range. inevis GmbH is entitled to reject the contractual offer contained therein. In the event of the customer&quot;s contractual offer being rejected, inevis GmbH will inform the customer of this immediately. All mutual legal transactions only come into effect after receipt of a written order confirmation from inevis GmbH, at the latest upon execution of the delivery.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> inevis GmbH reserves the right to correct printing errors and mistakes as well as minor deviations in quality and design, provided that these do not contradict a contractual obligation or agreement, and do not constitute defects. The information provided in our offers and online shop serves as a product description. They do not represent guaranteed properties. The customer is bound to the order placed for four weeks.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Prices / Payment / Default</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the prices are net prices in EURO and do not include costs for freight, transport, insurance, packaging and statutory duties, in particular the legally applicable sales tax. Unless otherwise agreed, the generally applicable list price of inevis GmbH on the day of delivery applies.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> Invoicing takes place upon delivery, delivery to the customer against cash on delivery, unless other written agreements have been made. In the case of delivery on open account, the entire invoice amount must be paid within the payment periods stated in the inevis GmbH invoices. Checks are only accepted as a condition of performance and bills of exchange are not accepted as a means of payment. Cash discounts may only be claimed if they have been promised by inevis GmbH in the invoice. Agreed cash discounts can in any case only be deducted on the condition that the customer is not in arrears with other payments. inevis GmbH can terminate payment terms granted or agreed to the customer by inevis GmbH at any time with immediate effect.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(c)</strong> Payment default occurs when the claim is due without the need for a reminder. In the event of payment default, inevis GmbH is entitled to demand default interest of 10% above the base interest rate. inevis GmbH reserves the right to claim higher or further damages. In the event of payment default, all claims of inevis GmbH from the entire business relationship become due immediately.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Offsetting / Retention / Assignment</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> Set-off by the customer is only permitted with undisputed and legally established claims.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> The assertion of liens by the buyer is excluded. Likewise excluded are the customer&quot;s rights of retention if they do not arise from the same legal relationship.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Delivery / Shipping / Transfer of Risk</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> Deliveries are made from the Frankfurt warehouse at the customer&quot;s expense. The risk of accidental deterioration or loss of the goods passes to the customer upon their handover, or in the case of a sale by dispatch, upon delivery of the item to the carrier, forwarding agent or another person or company designated to carry out the shipment. inevis GmbH is entitled to deliver from another location at any time, e.g. directly from the manufacturer&quot;s factory. The respective conditions then apply accordingly. Partial deliveries and partial services by inevis GmbH are permitted.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> inevis GmbH is not responsible for unforeseen obstacles to performance, such as those caused by sub-suppliers or force majeure, even in the case of agreed delivery periods, and entitles inevis GmbH to cancel delivery obligations in whole or in part, to extend delivery dates appropriately or to withdraw from the contract in whole or in part. inevis GmbH is only obliged to perform within the scope of proper self-delivery and assumes no liability for the risk of procurement. This also applies in the event of a delay in delivery that has already occurred.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(c)</strong> Delivery dates specified are non-binding guidelines. Expressly agreed delivery dates are deemed to have been met upon notification of readiness for dispatch and upon dispatch of the goods. Delivery dates are only valid under the condition that inevis GmbH receives its own deliveries properly and on time. In the event of a continuous impediment to performance lasting more than three months, the customer is entitled to withdraw from the part of the contract that has not yet been fulfilled, subject to a reasonable grace period of at least 10 working days.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(d)</strong> If a specific type of transport has not been expressly agreed in writing, the choice of transport route and type of transport is made by inevis GmbH without liability for the cheapest freight. The unconditional acceptance of the shipment by the railway, freight carrier or warehouse keeper is considered proof of the perfect condition of the goods and the transport packaging and excludes claims against inevis GmbH for damage, subject to proof to the contrary. Insurance is only taken out at the express written request of the customer and is at the customer&quot;s expense. If the shipment or delivery is delayed by the customer (delay in acceptance), inevis GmbH is entitled to demand storage fees of at least Â½% of the net invoice amount for each month started, starting 30 days after notification of readiness for shipment, subject to proof to the contrary. inevis GmbH also has the right to demand a higher amount upon proof. If the customer does not accept the goods after a grace period set for him, inevis is entitled to withdraw from the contract and to assert the rights under Section 10 of this agreement (compensation for refusal to accept) against the customer.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Retention of title / security</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> inevis GmbH retains title to the goods delivered (reserved goods) until all of its claims against the customer arising from the business relationship, including future claims from contracts concluded at the same time or later, have been settled. This also applies if individual or all of inevis GmbH&quot;s claims have been included in a current invoice and the balance has been drawn and acknowledged.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> The customer is obliged to treat the reserved goods with the necessary care and to insure them adequately against theft, fire and water damage at his own expense. The customer is only entitled to resell the reserved goods, to which inevis GmbH reserves title, in the ordinary course of business if the customer hereby and now assigns to inevis GmbH as security all existing and future claims in the amount of the final invoice amount that the customer has against buyers or third parties from the resale. However, the customer is not permitted to pledge or transfer the reserved goods as security. If reserved goods are sold unprocessed or after processing, reworking or combining with items that are the exclusive property of inevis GmbH, the processing, reworking or combining was carried out for inevis GmbH and the customer now assigns the claims in the final invoice amount arising from the resale to inevis GmbH. If the customer sells the reserved goods - after processing/combining them with goods that do not belong to inevis GmbH - inevis GmbH is entitled to the resulting co-ownership share, provided that sole ownership of the new item was acquired by the customer or a third party, and the customer hereby and now assigns the claims arising from the resale in the amount of the final invoice amount of the reserved goods with all ancillary rights and priority over the rest. inevis GmbH accepts the assignment. The customer is authorized to collect these claims even after the assignment. The authority of inevis GmbH to collect the claims itself remains unaffected by this; however, inevis GmbH undertakes not to collect the claim as long as the customer properly meets its payment and other obligations.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(c)</strong> inevis GmbH may demand that the customer inform it of the assigned claims and their debtors, provide all information necessary for collection, hand over the relevant documents and inform the debtors of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(e)</strong> The customer is obliged to immediately notify inevis GmbH in writing of any action that could impair or endanger the reserved ownership of the purchased item. The customer must provide inevis GmbH with all information necessary for defensive measures. Any costs of defensive measures that cannot be reimbursed by third parties will be reimbursed to inevis GmbH by the customer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(f)</strong> inevis GmbH is entitled at any time, even after conclusion of a contract, to demand sufficient security to secure its claims, including those not yet due, and to make further advance payments by inevis GmbH dependent on this. This applies in particular if doubts arise about the customer&quot;s creditworthiness, underfunding or liquidity gaps, etc., or if the original credit volume increases.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(g)</strong> After withdrawal from the contract due to the customer&quot;s breach of contract, inevis GmbH is entitled to demand the return of the reserved goods or the assignment of the customer&quot;s claim for return against third parties.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Warranty / Limitation Period</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> The prerequisite for any claims for defects by the customer against inevis GmbH is that the customer has complied with the inspection and complaint obligations in accordance with Section 377 of the German Commercial Code (HGB).
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The subject matter of the contract is exclusively the goods sold with the properties and characteristics as well as the intended use in accordance with the enclosed product description. Other or further properties and/or characteristics or an additional intended use are only deemed to have been agreed if they have been expressly confirmed in writing by inevis GmbH. Public statements or advertising by the manufacturer do not constitute a description of the quality of the purchased item. inevis GmbH cannot accept any liability for damage that is due to unsuitable or improper use or handling of the goods delivered, incorrect assembly or commissioning by the customer or third parties. The warranty obligation also does not include damage caused by wear and tear, unusual external influences, moisture, heat or cold. inevis GmbH is also released from its warranty obligation if the customer or third parties have made changes, modifications or attempts to remedy defects to the goods. The exemption from liability also applies to damage that is due to the use of third-party accessories.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> In the case of insignificant defects (minor damage) in new goods, inevis GmbH has the right to remedy the defect within a reasonable period of time set by the customer. If the customer requests subsequent performance in other cases, inevis GmbH can, at its discretion, remedy the defect or deliver defect-free goods. If subsequent performance fails, the customer has the right to reduce the purchase price or withdraw from the contract. If there is a dispute over the amount of the reduction, an expert opinion will be obtained from an expert appointed by the IHK Hessen. In the event of withdrawal, which must be declared in writing to inevis GmbH, the customer will be credited with the value resulting from the so-called current value calculation method (gross invoice price x [(average useful life - weighted use by the customer or third parties) ./. average useful life] ), provided that the defective goods are returned at the customer&quot;s expense and risk. If the customer also claims damages, this is limited to the customer&quot;s negative interest. The provisions of Section 8 of these Terms and Conditions also apply.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(c)</strong> The warranty period for new goods is two years from the invoice date of inevis GmbH. The warranty for used goods is excluded. The expiry of the limitation period is not suspended by negotiations about the warranty if the customer has not notified inevis GmbH of this in writing in advance. Defects can only be asserted immediately, at most within one week, after delivery and before use of the goods and with the granting of an immediate inspection by inevis GmbH, in writing and with a precise description of the defects. This also applies in the event that the goods are not handed over to the customer directly but to a third party named by the customer or if the customer forwards the goods. Defects that cannot be identified even during the required inspection must be asserted immediately after discovery. Regardless of the complaint of defects, the goods must be accepted and stored properly. Warranty claims due to defects that have not been properly reported are excluded. This also applies to notifications of defects after the warranty period has expired.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(d)</strong> In the event of transport damage, an immediate damage assessment must be carried out by the railway, post office, forwarding agent, parcel service, etc. before the goods are accepted and unloaded, and a written certificate must be obtained from the agency recording the damage. The customer is responsible for complying with limitation periods, e.g. under the General German Forwarding Conditions. The customer is responsible for safeguarding any rights of recourse against third parties.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(e)</strong> The standard of care to be observed by inevis GmbH when delivering goods is that of an entrepreneur.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(f)</strong> The customer is responsible for providing evidence of a defect, its existence at the time of transfer of risk and all other requirements for a claim.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(g)</strong> inevis GmbH cannot provide any warranty for rechargeable batteries and batteries.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          (h) Cost estimates are working time and the service is subject to a fee. The costs incurred for a cost estimate in the event of an unjustified complaint of defects will be invoiced to the customer separately in accordance with the generally applicable list price of inevis GmbH, provided that the customer withdraws from the order after the inspection has been carried out.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          (i) If the object of the order is not picked up within four weeks of the collection request, inevis GmbH may charge an appropriate storage fee after this period has expired. If the object is not picked up within three months of the collection request at the latest, the obligation to continue storing the object and any liability for damage or loss of the object caused by slight negligence shall no longer apply. After this three-month period has expired, inevis GmbH is entitled to sell the object of the order by private contract to cover its claim. Any excess proceeds shall be refunded to the customer.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          (j) The customerâs rights under Sections 478 et seq. of the German Civil Code (BGB) remain unaffected by these provisions.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">8. Liability</h3>
        <p className="mt-2">
          inevis is only liable for intent and gross negligence, unless essential contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which makes the proper execution of the contract possible in the first place and on whose compliance the contractual partner can regularly rely (cardinal obligations), are affected.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          If inevis is liable for minor negligence, the amount of liability is limited to the damages that were typically foreseeable at the time the contract was concluded. In the case of minor negligence, inevis is not liable for financial or consequential damages.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          inevis&quot;s statutory liability for damage to life, body and health as well as liability under the Product Liability Act, for fraudulent misrepresentation and liability for guarantee declarations remain unaffected by the above limitations of liability.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          To the extent that inevis&quot; liability is excluded or limited, this applies to all damages regardless of the legal basis as well as to the personal liability of inevisâ legal representatives, employees and other vicarious agents.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(b)</strong> Returned goods will be credited less 10% (but no more than â¬35.00) for processing and storage costs. Special orders or custom-made items are generally excluded from the possibility of return. All returns to inevis GmbH that are made after approval by inevis GmbH travel at the risk and expense of the sender. This also applies to the accidental loss of the goods. The shipments must reach inevis GmbH free of all transport and transport insurance costs as well as any other possible additional costs (e.g. delivery fee). Returns that are delivered carriage forward or even cash on delivery will not be accepted.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>(a)</strong> If the customer does not accept the goods in breach of contract, he is liable to inevis GmbH for the damage caused.

        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">

          <strong>(c)</strong> In the event of a violation of third-party industrial property rights, inevis GmbH is only liable to the extent that inevis GmbH knew or should have known that third-party industrial property rights were being violated and the customer is legally held liable. The amount of liability is limited to the final invoice amount for the goods delivered that violate the industrial property rights.
